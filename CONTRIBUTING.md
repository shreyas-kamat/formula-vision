## Commit & Branch Creation Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for our Commit Messages and Branch Creation

### Commits
An example commit message for fixing a bug in authentication would look like

```
fix(auth): Fixed Bug regarding Saving Refresh Token in Local DB
```

An example commit adding a feature giving the user a modal to select favourite driver would look like:

```
feat(ui): Added Selection Modal for Favourite Driver
```

### Branches
An example branch for a bug fix would look like:
```
fix/save-refresh-token
```

An example branch for a new feature would look like:
```
feat/favourite-driver-selection
```
  
<br/>

**Branches with Major Feature Updates**  
Any Branches created for Major Feature Updates (Breaking Changes) will just have a simple branch name and will not follow above procedure.   

  
For Example, for adding a feature like Live Data Fetching which will require an API a branch would look like:
```
live-data
```
